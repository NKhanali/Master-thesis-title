## CLC Genomics Workbench vs Genome Analysis Toolkit

### Abstract

Background: Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with small cell lung cancer (SCLCGW) accounting for approximately 15% of all cases. Despite advances in diagnostics and treatment, survival rates for SCLCGW remain poor, underscoring the urgent need for improved therapeutic strategies. Leveraging bioinformatics and DNA sequencing can enhance our understanding of the genetic landscape of SCLCGW and facilitate the development of more effective targeted therapies.
